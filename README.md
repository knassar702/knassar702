Hello! I'm a passionate security automation developer with experience in cyber security. I specialize in developing security automation tools using Rust and Python, including the crab snake library.

My interest in cyber security began when I started working as a bug bounty hunter. Through this experience, I gained extensive knowledge of web application security and vulnerability exploitation. I have also participated in several CTF competitions, where I honed my skills in reverse engineering and exploit development.

My approach to security automation development is centered around safety, speed, and efficiency. I prioritize reliability, security, and efficiency, and always ensure that my tools are rigorously tested and optimized.

I work closely with my clients to understand their unique security challenges and develop customized tools to address those challenges. Whether it's network traffic analysis, vulnerability scanning, or intrusion detection, I'm always eager to take on new challenges and help organizations enhance their security posture.

If you're looking for a skilled security automation engineer with a strong background in cyber security, please don't hesitate to reach out. Let's work together to keep your organization safe and secure.
